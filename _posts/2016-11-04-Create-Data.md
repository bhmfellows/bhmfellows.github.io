Title: INLS 161 - Data
category: coursework
---

This was the first time we've dealt with collaborative work in GitHub and it definitely took some
effort to adjust to. We initially approached the assignment by all sitting around Celine's computer. 
She made the repository and pulled it into her cloud9 environment, while Christiana and I pulled up
resources on our screens and directed Celine on how to write the questions script. 

Then when I wanted to write some test code to try and figure out how to get a date stamp into a variable, 
so I made a test file in a new repository. Once I got that working, I pulled the most current version into 
cloud9 and added my validated test code. Thinking about it now, this would have been a great opportunity to use a 
testing branch and then merge them back together. 


## Challenges

The biggest challenge we faced with Assignment 4 was using GitHub as a collaboration tool. 
I am comfortable pushing and pulling my own work, but this was the first experience we've had 
working with other people in one repository. Clear communication was really important for working 
through process of who could edit and push when.

We ran into problems repeatedly with forgetting to pull before pushing, and especially when were all 
editing the same lines of code at the same time. 

I also had a lightbulb moment when Christiana was trying to 'rewrite history'. She encountered a merge
conflict and was going to just revise the files in her repository to match what was in the remote repository.
I hadn't thought to do that before, so when she did I realized why that was bad and understood more how the 
commit history.
