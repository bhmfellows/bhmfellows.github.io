[EducationNC](https://www.ednc.org/about/) is a collection of organizations dedicated to expanding educational opportunities for all children in North Carolina.
I periodically create illustrations and data visualizations to supplement content published on EducationNC sites.

As EdNC is an organization focused on education, I use a hand-drawn style remniscent of teachers and students writing on a whiteboard.
I use Adobe Creative Cloud tools to digitize and edit my pen drawings.

Many of the graphics illustrate complex ideas and processes. 
To create these, I talk with the article's author to understand the key ideas, and work backwards to represent these points visually.
