Title: Branching

Branching confused me a little bit in class, so I'm making an additional post to store resources I found to help clarify the topic.

This a diagram from GitHub explaining how the __master__ branch carries on the linear path, while an experimental branch can diverge off.

This diagram also factors in using GitHub as a collaborative tool. 
So, when someone is happy with a branch they have worked on, they can submit a __pull request__ that asks for the project owner to look at the revisions and merge it back in with master.



This is a great video from Daniel Shiffman's _Coding Rainbow_ channel. It goes into depth with how to branch, commit changes on that branch, and eventually merge back to the master.

And this was originally covered in class and on the INLS 161 [course website](https://silshack.github.io/inls161fall2016/web/2016/09/28/branching-and-merging/).
