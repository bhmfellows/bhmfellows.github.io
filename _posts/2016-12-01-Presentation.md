# The Process

[Grace](https://gma96.github.io/about/) and I worked together to come up with a rough outline for the presentation 
and I put the outline into the cloud9 workspace.
We then split up the outline so that I worked on the second half and Grace worked on the first half. 
For my half I researched more in depth, made the slides, wrote the script, and recorded for those slides.

# Challenges

I think the biggest challenge we encountered with this project was working with someone else in the same file.
This has been a challenge for all of the group projects, and I'm starting to get used to it a little bit more.
This one was different because we did a lot more work remotely, and had to communicate with each other
when someone was editing the presentation and when it was time to pull an updated version. 
We successfully worked on the same document in class at the same time. That was a breakthrough for me.
I was nervous doing it and thought that some of our work would disappear, but it worked. As long as we 
were editing under different headings the merge conflicts were easy to resolve. It took some trial and 
error to figure out the correct workflow of one user pulling, editing, running the script, committing pushing, and then
the other user committing, then pulling, etc. We initially forgot to have the second user commit first.
