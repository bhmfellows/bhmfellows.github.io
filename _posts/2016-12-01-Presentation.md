# The Process

[Grace](https://gma96.github.io/about/) and I reflected on what we had learned this semester and talked about the 
topics that we were interested in learning more about. I recalled the article from the first day of class: 
[How Technology Hijacks People’s Minds — from a Magician and Google’s Design Ethicist](https://medium.com/swlh/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3).
I've been thinking about it off and on all semester and had read further about it on my own. 

I really enjoy this video from [Time Well Spent](timewellspent.io), and it was influential in the making of our presentation.

After settling on this as our topic, Grace and I worked together to come up with a rough outline for the presentation 
and I put the outline into the cloud9 workspace. We then split up the outline. Grace worked on the first half, which focuses
on the impact of digital technology on our brains and behavior. I worked on the second half, which focuses more on specific
examples of how technology is designed to exploit phychological weaknesses. 
 
We completed the research for our respective halves and settled on a rough draft of the script and presentation in a 
shared google doc. From there we added our parts to the markdown file in the Cloud9 workspace and recorded the script 
for our respective parts. During the final work day we put it all together, ran the script for the final time, and 
added the audio clips to the slides in the index.html file. 


# Challenges

I think the biggest challenge we encountered with this project was working with someone else in the same file.
This has been a challenge for all of the group projects, and I'm starting to get used to it a little bit more.
This one was different because we did a lot more work remotely, and had to communicate with each other
when someone was editing the presentation and when it was time to pull an updated version. 
We successfully worked on the same document in class at the same time. That was a breakthrough for me.
I was nervous doing it and thought that some of our work would disappear, but it worked. As long as we 
were editing under different headings the merge conflicts were easy to resolve. It took some trial and 
error to figure out the correct workflow of one user pulling, editing, running the script, committing pushing, and then
the other user committing, then pulling, etc. We initially forgot to have the second user commit first.


# INLS 161 Final Project

At this point in the class, I'm used to feeling overwhelmed and confused at the start of a project, and still confused
over halfway through. The difference with this project was that I'm okay with it now. It got easier with each project to
trust in my abilities to break down the problem into manageable pieces and work through each one. Merge conflicts 
no longer terrify me. I feel confident in my understanding of what's going on in GitHub and Cloud9. And I'm also confident
in my ability to teach myself how to complete similar projects using new tools or features.

On a technical level, this project combined most of the skills we have been developing over the course of the 
semester. I used git, markdown, scripting, HTML & CSS, and GitHub Pages, all of which we learned previously. 
For this assignment, we learned how to use Reveal.JS for making a presentation and Audacity for recording and editing
audio.


# Reflecting On This Semester

This class definitely gave me the skills and attitude to create more with technoloy and consume less. It forced me to
think critically about the role of technology in my life, and showed me new ways to make original content and manipulate 
existing media. I really enjoyed the more opinion-based readings because they gave context to the technical skills we 
were learning in class. 

Technology and the tools available change rapidly and it's impossible to stay on top of all of it. This class 
taught me to be comfortable with not knowing exactly how to use a tool. Through a lot of trial and error I learned
how to break down problems into small enough chunks that even a novice can tackle. I learned how to find and recognize useful
resources.

I already used GitHub at [HackNC](https://ohreagano.github.io/inls161/2016/10/31/HackNC.html), and I know I will use it more 
in the future. The ability to collaborate so easily is powerful. I also think it's awesome how easy it is to find existing 
projects on GitHub, fork or clone, and build something on top of it.

I have already used a lot of what I learned to help one of my friends set up a [portfolio](http://www.danleibel.com/).
It's still a work in progress, but it's awesome that I now know how to build a website and put original content online.
I really enjoy the flexibility of using markdown and CSS. Previously I've set up sites with WordPress and I was constantly 
battling against the theme and settings. I also am planning to revise my own site and use that as more of a portfolio. 

This class expanded my view of what I can accomplish with technology.
