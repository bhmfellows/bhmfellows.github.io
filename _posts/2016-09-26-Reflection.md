# Tools for Information Literacy: Course Progress & Reflection

This class has taught me tons of useful tools for interacting with the web and creating my own material. 
Here's a brief overview of the tools I've learned to use so far in the course. 

## Git

Git is a __free__, open-source _version_ control system, sometimes called "Autosave on steroids". 
Version control means that it saves chunks of change you make to a project, so you can revert back to an older version if you mess it up.
Git provides a way to fork a project and then put it back together. 
[This](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git) is an Atlassian tutorial I enjoyed explaining the basics of git and why you should use it.

## GitHub

GitHub is a social media platform that provides a space for sharing and collaborating on projects. It runs using Git and provides a structured community and platform.

Key activities in git are Forking, Cloning, Branching, Merging, and Committing. 
Each commit is a saved version of changes made. You can revert commits, even if its not the most recent commit. 
GitHub can be used remotely (like in Cloud 9 or from Terminal) and then pushed back to your GitHub repository, or you can work on your project directly in the GitHub repository.

## Cloud 9

Cloud9 is a cloud-based development environment that provides a workspace for all of the files related to any project. 
It has a command line built in, and a visual interface that makes it easier to see the structure of your files and move around within them.

## Jekyll

Jekyll is a simple static site generator. It's awesome. 
My favorite part about Jekyll is that I can run a Jekyll gem (application) that demos my project on a temporary part of the web. 
This means that I can make changes and see them in real time, rather than needing to 'commit' each time I want to see what effect a change in my code makes on the overall site.

To view a site, use the following code in a separate terminal and view the changes you make in almost real time: 
```
jekyll serve --host=$IP --port=$PORT --drafts
```

## Markdown

[Markdown](http://kirkstrobeck.github.io/whatismarkdown.com/) is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web developers. 
That means you can write in a more natural style (like I am in this post!), and avoid all the complicated HTML tags that mess with writing flow.
Markdown allows you to focus on the content, and the machine takes care of the gritty details. 

## GitHub Pages

Pages provides a free web-hosting for static pages with XXX.github.io domain names. Or, it even lets you use a domain name you own and host it via GitHub pages! 
GitHub Pages are a great tool for learning programming and git basics via a front-facing platform.
