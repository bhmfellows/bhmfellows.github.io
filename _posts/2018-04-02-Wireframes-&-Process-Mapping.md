Title: Wireframes & Process Mapping
category: portfolio
---

I work as a UX Designer at [PublicInput.com](https://publicinput.com/), civic tech startup creating public engagement software.
My UX design process varies by project, but here's a step-by-step look at how I designed a new feature to support data collection and engagement at live events.

First, we met with one of PublicInput's customers to discuss opportunities for growing their use of PublicInput's platform.
In that discussion, we uncovered some of the problems around engagement at public meetings and talked through potential solutions. 

Armed with notes from the meeting, I sketched out a process map for making public meetings more accessible and increasing public engagment. 
This includes allowing admin to create an event, broadcast the meeting through YouTube Live, and collect online comment and questions prior to and during the meeting time.

After discussing the process map with stakeholders, I created wireframes in Keynote for the MVP.
The wireframes contain notes and instructions to the software development team.

From there, the developers coded the feature in PublicInput's software and we entered the iterative process of seeking feedback and refining the product.
