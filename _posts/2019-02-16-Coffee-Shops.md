Paul’s Entirely Subjective and Somewhat Definitive Guide to Birmingham Coffee Shops (Ranked in No Particular Order)


Name | Ambiance | Price | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Birmingham Breadworks | Chill Bakery | $$ | No better spot for reasonable pastries. Buy fancy bread here. Great place to work, but there are very few plugs. Excellent avocado toast.
Revelator (Downtown) | Trendy, clean, and expensive | $$$ | A VFA Sunday afternoon favorite, it’s spacious and modern and probably going out of business.
Seeds Coffee (Homewood) | “I’m married with cute kids” | $$ | Friendliest staff around. Housed in a converted gas station with plenty of seating. A great place to crank out work on the weekends. 
Seeds Coffee (Lakeview) | “Not married yet, but close” | $$ | Exactly the same as above, except younger, smaller, and in Lakeview. 
Church Street Coffee and Books | Cozy bookstore | $$ | Stays open later than most coffee shops, a frequent high school study spot with amazing chocolate chip cookies.
Revelator Crestline | Hip and expensive | $$$ | Typical Revelator, it’s clean and quiet and everything looks (and is) expensive. 
Sweet Jon’s | Hipster pregame | $$$ | I love this spot. Excellent brunch, with a cool plant room and a playlist on Sundays that makes it feel like it could spontaneously trigger a dance party at any moment. Part of Revelator though, so it’s expensive.
Saturn | Retro space age | $$ | Retro video games and board games make this spot hard for me to work in, but fun for hanging out.
The Abbey | Literal church | $ | I’ve never been to another coffee shop like it. It’s an actual church with services at 4pm on Sundays and frequently serves the homeless. Byzantine posters and an actual altar add to its charm.
Starbucks (all locations) | Starbucks | $$ | It’s fine
Crestwood Coffee | Old diner | $ | Good food options, reasonable coffee, and semi-reliable wifi. 
Lucy’s Coffee and Tea | Local college hangout | $ | Often features local art on the walls and has decent cheap coffee. I want to go here more often.
Octane (Uptown) | Misplaced, but friendly | $$$ | Attached to a hotel and lacking much menu variety, it’s not my favorite coffee shop, but convenient if you’re near Uptown 
Red Cat (Railroad Park) | Meh | $$ | Lattes are expensive but delicious. Convenient location, but just-ok interior
Red Cat (Pepper Place) | Antique store | $$ | Better than the above location, with more parking and more people. The Burmese latte is my favorite. 
Urban Standard | Brooklyn | $$ | Birmingham’s first attempt at a hipster coffee shop, it’s the original trendy downtown breakfast spot with plenty of seats and a decent selection of breakfast food
O’Henrys (all locations) | Decadent | $$ | Has good baked items. The one in Highland Park is hilariously tiny. The Homewood one is busy, and the little-visited Brookwood Mall location has a cool upstairs
Caveat| A nicely renovated home | $$ | It has a backyard! Get the draft latte if you like lattes, it’s excellent. 
FILTER Coffee Parlor | You’re about to go on a nice apartment tour | $$ | The owners are nice and social, and there’s a fun upstairs part. Focus is on promoting Birmingham crafts and foods. I recommend the cortado. 
Woodlawn Cycle Cafe | Williamsburg, Brooklyn in the early 2000’s | $$$ | The food is excellent, and the interior is cozy and fancy. It’s not a spot for getting work done (not sure they have public wifi)
