Title: Assignment 3: Pandoc & Scripting
category: inls161
---


## Abstract

The original work I used for this assignment is a federalist paper arguing for adoption of a new constitution agreed upon
in my POLI 409 course: Mock Constitutional Convention. It examines the gun rights clause, which makes the right to own and
operate a gun an individual right. By making it an individual right, this Constitution ensures citizens’ right to self-defense
and allows for lawful recreational gun use. It codifies the modern shift away from the current US Constitution’s militia 
interpretation and prevents civilian access to military-style weapons that have no reasonable civilian purpose.
