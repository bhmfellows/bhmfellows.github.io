# Meet Fatimah Warner

Noname, the stage name of 25-year-old Chicago native Fatimah Warner, is widely recognized as a blossoming talent in rap and hip-hop. 
Her self-released debut mixtape, _Telefone_, made it onto NPR’s [“Best 50 Albums of 2016”](http://apps.npr.org/best-music-2016/list/top-albums/), 
Rolling Stone’s [“40 Best Rap Albums of 2016”](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/40-best-rap-albums-of-2016-w455769/kanye-west-the-life-of-pablo-w456100), 
Nerdist’s [“15 Best Albums of 2016”](https://nerdist.com/the-15-best-albums-of-2016/), 
and USA Today’s [“50 Best Albums of 2016”](http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/12/the-50-best-albums-of-2016). 
Noname’s 2016 - 2017 _Telefone_ tour sold out around the US. 
And as of October 2017--more than a year since her latest release--Noname gets 730,000 monthly listeners on Spotify and _Telefone_ has more than one million plays on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/noname). 
However, Noname defies many conventions of a popular female rap artist, and I think her success carves out a new space for women in hip-hop.

# Roles in Hip-Hop

In order to understand Noname in the context of hip-hop culture, I want to consider the evolution of identities, both male and female, in rap. 

> Starting in the late 80s and continuing through the 90s, hip-hop blossomed into its most 
> mainstream-recognizable incarnation: gangsta rap. Gangsta rap is where rap music finally hit 
> its stride...For gangsta-era rappers, even when discussing devastating, deeply emotional 
> circumstances, appearing “hard”—or in the very least, not appearing soft—was primary….
> The reasons for gangsta rap’s bravado and toughness directly stem from the social conditions 
> out of which the genre emerged (Denton, 2015). 

As author Ta-Nehisi Coates explains, rappers’ expression of toughness and stoicism can be a necessary means to appear powerful and strong when surrounded by violence and uncertainty. Vulnerability can become a liability. Furthermore, because of rap’s origins as a “hard” genre, it is still considered a predominantly male genre that looks down upon gentleness and femininity.  

> Rap had long been dominated by men, and women in the industry had to fight sexist
> stereotypes only men could rap. These female MCs also had to contend with stereotypes
> about the fragility of women in a deeply masculine genre (Denton, 2015). 

In order to make it in this cultural environment, female rappers adopted distinct ‘acceptable’ identities to garner acceptance, respect, and popularity. Similar to female experiences across the music industry, female rap artists face “overt sexism regarding their creative capabilities” (Keyes, 2000, p. 273). And they are often evaluated mostly on image, rather than creative and musical talents. Author Cheryl Keyes argues that these tropes are “spaces from which to deliver powerful messages from Black female and Black feminist perspectives” (2001, p. 265).

## The “Queen Mother”

The first trope is the “queen mother”. She embodies “black female empowerment and spirituality” and her lyrics are “mature” but not motherly (Keyes, 2000, p. 266). She “demands respect for [herself] and all black women” (Keyes, 2000, p. 266). One prominent example of this identity is Queen Latifah. 

## The “Fly Girl”

The second trope, the “fly girl”, focuses more on the erotic as a source of power. She wears chic styles and her clothing highlights parts of the black female body often looked down upon: “full breasts and rounded buttocks and thighs” (Keyes, 2000, p. 269). Like Salt-N-Pepa and Missy Elliott, the “fly girl” is “an erotic subject rather than an objectified one” (Keyes, 2000, p. 269).

## The “Sista with Attitude”

The third trope, the “sista with attitude”, “value[s] attitude as a means of empowerment and present themselves accordingly” (Keyes, 2000, p. 271). She does what the boys of hip-hop do: references sex and drugs, brags about her skills and party habits. Some reclaim the word “bitch” as a subversion of the patriarchy. For example, Nicki Minaj adopts a “bad bitch” persona. 

## The “Lesbian”

And the last trope is the “lesbian”. Independent of sexuality, the “lesbian” rapper adopts male postures and baggier clothes, in a sense obscuring her sexuality and gender identity.
