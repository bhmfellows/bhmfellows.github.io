# Meet Fatimah Warner

Noname, the stage name of 25-year-old Chicago native Fatimah Warner, is widely recognized as a blossoming talent in rap and hip-hop. 
Her self-released debut mixtape, _Telefone_, made it onto NPR’s [“Best 50 Albums of 2016”](http://apps.npr.org/best-music-2016/list/top-albums/), 
Rolling Stone’s [“40 Best Rap Albums of 2016”](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/40-best-rap-albums-of-2016-w455769/kanye-west-the-life-of-pablo-w456100), 
Nerdist’s [“15 Best Albums of 2016”](https://nerdist.com/the-15-best-albums-of-2016/), 
and USA Today’s [“50 Best Albums of 2016”](http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/12/the-50-best-albums-of-2016). 
Noname’s 2016 - 2017 _Telefone_ tour sold out around the US. 
And as of October 2017--more than a year since her latest release--Noname gets 730,000 monthly listeners on Spotify and _Telefone_ has more than one million plays on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/noname). 
However, Noname defies many conventions of a popular female rap artist, and I think her success carves out a new space for women in hip-hop.

## Louder Than a Bomb: Spoken Word to Rap

Noname’s music and image are feminine and authentic, and her lyrics explore her experience growing up as a black girl in Chicago. As a teenager, she started doing spoken word poetry in a community group for young artists called YOUmedia.

After achieving recognition in Chicago’s spoken word community, Noname transitioned her talents to rap with help from friends at YOUmedia including Chance the Rapper, Mick Jenkins, and Saba. In an interview with _Now Toronto_, Noname described her move to rap: “The spaces for spoken word can be depressing, and poetry can be really serious. I wanted to inject light into my work, and rap is fun.” While fun and light-hearted melodies underly her songs, Noname carries the emotional power of spoken word into rap. 


Noname starts at 2:15 in Chance's performance on Saturday Night Live
