Title: Explainer Videos
category: portfolio
---

I worked alongside [Protopia](https://protopia.co/)'s founder in the customer discovery phase and focused my research and outreach on two potential market segments: bar associations and startup organizations. 
I engaged with those organizations through emails and phone calls to set up informational interviews and product demos and tracked my progress in Hubspot. 
Using the feedback gathered in customer discovery, I created two engaging explainer videos introducing the product and its value to customers.

To create the videos, I first wrote the script and mapped out a storyboard to incorporate the founder's vision and pain points of potential customers.
I then hired a voice actor on Fiverr to bring the script to life, and worked with him to create the right pace and tone. 
With the voiceover in hand, I used GoAnimate to produce the videos displayed here. 
Throughout the process, I updated Protopia's founder and asked for his feedback on my progress.
