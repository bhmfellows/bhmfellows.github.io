Over the past few months, teachers in Arizona, Kentucky, and West Virginia have been speaking out to demand better education funding in the #RedforEd movement, and North Carolina teachers might be the next to join in. On Wednesday, May 16, educators from North Carolina will gather in Raleigh for an advocacy day. But educators make it clear this is about much more than a raise. 

The Raleigh event’s name, the [March for Students and Rally for Respect](https://www.facebook.com/events/570818366627097/), nods to the educators’ real concerns. 

At a Reach NC Voices teacher focus group in March, 14 Triangle-area teachers gathered for a catered dinner to discuss the most pressing issues they face at work. Participants spoke freely under the protection of anonymity. One unexpected theme emerged: the lack of student support services. All 14 teachers told stories of going beyond their job description to support students outside of the classroom.

A young Teach for America fellow said she can’t expect her students to focus on learning when their basic needs aren’t being met. 

> Sometimes academic needs are the last thing a kid needs. Some of my students are homeless, being threatened by gangs. They don’t have food at home, or basic health needs met.

> It’s hard emotionally. Sometimes I just go home and cry.

Many young teachers in the group echoed this sentiment.

A few teachers suggested it would be helpful to have a database of student support resources, like dentists or ophthalmologists across the state that are willing to provide low or no cost services to students in need. They frequently share resources like this on a one-off basis, but there’s no comprehensive list. 

> We need more and better support services. When we know a kid needs help, who do we turn to? I don’t know.

> How are our students supposed to feel supported with not enough guidance counselors and support positions such as teacher assistants?

North Carolina’s school funding reports tell the same story. 

On average, North Carolina school districts have one school guidance counselor for every 359 students. That’s roughly one hundred students more than the [1:250 counselor to student ratio](https://www.schoolcounselor.org/press) that the American School Counselor Association recommends. Only 8 school districts in North Carolina met this standard for the 2017-2018 academic year.

The chart below shows the range of counselor to student ratios in North Carolina. It excludes 3 school districts that are outliers: Clay County (1:1307), Pamlico County (1:1251), and Caswell County (1:873).

The numbers are worse for school psychologists. On average, North Carolina school districts have one school psychologist for every 1,808 students. That’s nearly three times the the [1:500-700 psychologist to student ratio](http://www.ncpublicschools.org/studentsupport/psychology/standards-training/) that the National Association of School Psychologists recommends.

Only 2 school districts in North Carolina met the recommended ratio for the 2017-2018 academic year.

Additionally, 20 school districts do not have a school psychologist, leaving roughly 60,000 students statewide without access to their support.

While there’s no one fix, funding more student support services would help alleviate the burden on teachers and likely improve education outcomes.
