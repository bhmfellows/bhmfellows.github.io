# Process of Source Search and Exploration

In creating this resource guide, I had to recognize my own intent and biases. While I do want to give fair consideration and representation to all sides, I personally believe Confederate symbols should not be publicly used in a present-tense context. I do not advocate for the erasure of Confederate symbols or history, but do believe they should be removed from public spaces and replaced with names and objects more representative of our community values and accomplishments.

My intended audience is people who do not understand or recognize the controversy and nuance in Confederate symbols. It’s a divisive issue, and many people tend to be passionately opposed to or fervently for the flag without understanding the other sides. My goal with this resource guide is that after exploring the recommended sources, the viewer will be able to appreciate the many perspectives on Confederate symbols and their placement today. 

My approach to this project began with a broad search to identify recurring viewpoints and subtopics. To account for Google’s personalized search, which was mostly returning liberal-leaning sources, I used a different browser. I searched Google and the UNC library database using terms like “Confederate symbols”, “Confederate flag”, and “Confederate monument”, read through top results, and took notes on the key points, purpose, and author bias. While doing this, I kept a running list of important viewpoints and topics the guide needed to include to be satisfactorily comprehensive. My list contained the following: controversy over Civil War cause and history, resurgence of Confederate symbols at peaks of racism and oppression, uses of Confederate symbols outside of the American South, other ways to commemorate Confederate history, and direct use of the symbol by hate groups.  

I then used that list of topics to lead my search for and examination of sources. When choosing sources, I wanted to make it accessible and engaging for the viewer. This means I avoided lengthy or dry sources and articles that could only be reached through a university library login. Furthermore, I looked for a variety of mediums including text, graphics, video, and audio. I balanced accessibility with an intent to present the full, complicated picture of Confederate symbols. I considered numerous sources for each topic I wanted to cover, and aimed to choose sources that compliment one another and progress the conversation.
