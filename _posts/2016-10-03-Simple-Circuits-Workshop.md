Title: Simple Circuits Workshop

I attended a Simple Circuits workshop October 3. 
It's part of the [Kenan Science Library Be A Maker Workshop series](http://library.unc.edu/makerspace/workshops/).

This was my first visit to the [UNC Makerspace](http://library.unc.edu/makerspace/)! They do tons of workshops each week teaching skills to make stuff. 
And the makerspace has some cool resources for students including:

- 3D printers
- 3D scanners
- Sewing machine
- Raspberry Pi starter packs
- A soldering iron!
- And all kinds of software for electronics and 3D design

The workshop was a brief, hands-on introduction to circuits using breadboards, LED lights, and a 9 volt battery. Here's the base circuit we made with the instructor:

I chose to attend this workshop because circuits power most things I interact with every day and it would be cool to have a better understanding of what's going on. 
Although I still don't quite understand how these simple circuits are combined to eventually create a computer. That might take more than a one-hour workshop to understand.

# 8 Things I Learned:

1. What's a breadboard?? It's a large electrical board with a grid of electrical connections underneath It's an easy way to play around with circuits and see what will happen before you solder stuff together.
2. Why is it called a breadboard? The original breadboards were actually wooden boards that people sliced bread on.
3. Resistors are important because they reduce the current flow. Without a resistor, or if it's placed poorly in the circuit, the LED bulb might be overwhelmed by too much energy.
4. Parallel circuits have 2 or more paths for the current to flow through. The facilitator made the analogy to multiple lunch lines. If one gets blocked up, or overloaded, the other lines still function.
5. Series circuits are arranged in a single chain, so if one gets blocked up, they all don't work (like christmas lights!). The benefit of this type of circuit is that all of the power flows through the whole thing. 
6. Houses "ground" high voltage electrical currents through a metal rod that goes a few feet into the ground. The current gets dispersed in the earth.
7. When we "ground" a current in the breadboard it goes back into the battery.
8. [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction) is an awesome open-source electronics platform for prototyping without much experience in electronics or programming. The makerspace offers workshops on this too!
