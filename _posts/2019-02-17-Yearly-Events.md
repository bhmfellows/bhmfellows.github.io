# Downtown

Apartment living, close to good restaurants and Railroad Park. Publix grocery store coming soon. 2-bedroom apartments rent $1,500-2,000/mo.

# Avondale

Hipster neighborhood 5 minutes from downtown. Restaurants, coffee shops, breweries, and bungalows. Let a 2018er know if you’re looking to move in and we’ll scout it out- safety varies street by street.

# Five Points / Southside

College bars, restaurants, Insomnia Cookies., all at one central hub. Also some really nice restaurants a few blocks away. 

# Lakeview

Good eats, chill bars, dance clubs, and a surprisingly vibrant gay scene. Prepare for a fun night out on the town. 

# Highland Park

Historic homes, quaint condos, and some goods eats, all 5-10 minutes from downtown. High concentration of grad students around.

# Woodlawn

Some gentrification going on here, but worth visiting. Highlights include an awesome street festival, and great coffee and food at Cycle Cafe.

# Crestwood and Crestline 

5 minutes from Avondale, 10 minutes from downtown, quiet neighborhoods with 3-4 bedroom homes rent $1,400-$1,850/mo.

# Homewood

Mostly young families and young professionals. Good eats, sweet houses, but traffic on 280 is the worst.

# Suburbs

Housing in Vestavia Hills, Cahaba Heights, and Hoover is all 20-30 minutes outside of downtown Birmingham. Mountain Brook is an elite enclave of mansions within 15 minutes of downtown.

edit note: we should add a map with neighborhoods marked + density of fellows in each
