Hi I'm Reagan. I'm a senior at UNC Chapel Hill studying information science and entrepreneurship. 

I'm making this website as part of [INLS 161: Tools for Information Literacy](https://silshack.github.io/inls161fall2016/). 
For now it will house my assignments, notes, and resources for the course, and serve as a playground while I learn some front-end web development.
