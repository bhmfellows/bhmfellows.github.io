## Using Categories

Categories are little bit tricky. Please make sure to do the following for each category:

Create a file within categories folder with the name of your category For example let's say that we have a category called An Awesome Category you will need to add an an-awesome-category.html file with this content:
---
layout: category
category: an-awesome-category
permalink: /categories/an-awesome-category/
---
Create an entry inside _data/categories.yml
- slug: an-awesome-category
  name: An Awesome Category
Then you will see it in the footer in the Explore section.
